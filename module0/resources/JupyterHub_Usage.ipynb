If you get stuck with a busy kernel, you can interrupt it without shutting down your notebook by selecting `Kernel > Interrupt` or by pressing `'I'` twice (see keyboard shortcuts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since crashes or busy kernels can happen when dealing with large data, it is important to keep your work up-to-date by constantly saving your notebooks. Selecting `File > Save and Checkpoint` will save your most recent work and create a checkpoint that you can revert to if needed. You can go back to a previously saved checkpoint by selecting it from `File > Revert to Checkpoint`. Just like in the example below, your checkpoints will be listed with the date and time of your last update.\n",
